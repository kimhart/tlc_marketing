          <p>We may share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in the following instances:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>To comply with the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of THE REWARD COMPANY, Inc. d/b/a TLC Marketing Worldwide or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</li>
