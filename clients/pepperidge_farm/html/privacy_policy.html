        <p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
        <p>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</p>
        <p>3.1 Personally Identifiable Information</p>
        <p>We may share or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information in the following instances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To comply with the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of THE REWARD COMPANY, Inc. d/b/a TLC Marketing Worldwide or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.</li>

          <li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us, or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.2  Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
        <p>We may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with third parties, but we will always anonymize it to ensure that you cannot be identified either from the information itself or through combining it with other information that the transferee is likely to have or obtain</p>
        <p>4. International Transfer of Information</p>
        <p>If you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information, THE REWARD COMPANY, Inc. d/b/a TLC Marketing Worldwide may transfer that information to other Group companies or affiliates or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

        <p>If you provide information as part of a promotional campaign your personally identifiable information will normally be stored in database for the duration of the campaign. Data and records will not be kept for longer than is necessary. This principle finds statutory form in the Data Protection Act 1998, which requires that personal data processed for any purpose "shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose.” No data file or record should be retained for more than five years after it is closed unless a good reason for longer retention can be demonstrated.</p>
